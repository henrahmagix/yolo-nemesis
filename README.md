# YOLO Nemesis

You hate people saying YOLO. You hate them so much now you hate the world. You think everyone says it, so you want to ruin everyone's day. Do it your way!

### It's a game

A web game, so it's JavaScript.

### It's a small sandbox

So you can go anywhere you want.

### You have to annoy happy people

The happier they are, the more points you get for successfully annoying them. They have an annoyance tolerance, so some are hard to annoy and you will lose points if you don't annoy them enough. Repeating the same action will have a lesser effect: it's YOLO after all, not YCLAMAYL <sub>(you can live as much as you like)</sub>.

If your points dwindle, you will become irritable, and as a result less likely to annoy people and more likely to lose points.

There is a time limit and a number of points to gain over a number of rounds. You win when you hit the points target within the number of rounds. A round ends immediately if you become too irritable.

### But don't be a douchebag

If you're too mean to a group of people in close proximity, they will band together to annoy you and make your mission difficult. People you haven't annoyed may decide to join them. They can steal points from you and end the round early: *annoyance is an art form*.
